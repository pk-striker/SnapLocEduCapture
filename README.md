# SnapLocEduCapture
Welcome to my GitHub repository for the website I've developed! ðŸŒŸ

Here, you'll find a website designed specifically for capturing pictures of people. It's essential to mention that this platform is solely intended for educational purposes. Kindly refrain from using it for any other intentions.

This website boasts a nifty feature allowing users to capture both images and locations. Recently, I've fine-tuned the functionality for camera capture and location tracking, ensuring smooth operation. Rest assured, I've personally tested these features on various devices to guarantee their reliability.

To get started with the installation, simply run the following commands:

```bash
composer require mobiledetect/mobiledetectlib:^4.8 matomo/device-detector:^3.13
```

Additionally, I utilize Discord webhook to store pictures, location, and related information. Feel free to explore the repository and share any feedback or suggestions you may have. Let's keep this learning journey collaborative and exhilarating! ðŸš€
