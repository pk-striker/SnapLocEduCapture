# SnapLocEduCapture
Welcome to my GitHub repository for the website I've created! ðŸŒŸ

This repository houses a website I've developed with the aim of capturing pictures of people. It's important to note that this website is strictly for educational purposes only, so please refrain from using it for any other purposes.

The website incorporates a feature to capture both pictures and locations. I've recently updated the functionality for both the camera capture and location tracking, and I'm pleased to report that they are working seamlessly. I've tested these features on my own devices to ensure their reliability.

While the core functionalities are in place and operational, please be aware that I haven't yet addressed the display of capture devices information. This is on my to-do list, but with exams looming, I haven't had the opportunity to tackle it just yet.

Feel free to explore the repository and provide any feedback or suggestions you may have. Let's keep the learning journey collaborative and exciting! ðŸš€
